---

## 🎓 Year 11–12 (VCE) Subject Choices for Law

* **History**, **English Literature**, **Economics**, **Philosophy**, **Politics or Global Politics**, **Society & Culture** ([Matrix Education][4]).

### 🧠 Why these help:

## ✅ Next Steps for You

1. **Choose your Year 11 subjects now:**

   * **Mandatory**: English Units 1/2 now, then Units 3/4 in Year 12.
   * **Highly recommended**: Legal Studies Units 1/2 (Year 11) and Units 3/4 (Year 12).
   * **Supplementary**: Select one or more of History, Economics, Politics, Literature or Philosophy to build analysis and writing skills.

2. **Aim for a high ATAR (mid‑90s+)** if you hope to attend top‑ranked law schools like Melbourne, Monash, ANU, or UNSW. Early‑entry schemes are available but extremely competitive (ATAR in high‑90s plus strong extracurriculars) ([Reddit][17], [Google Sites][8], [Virtual School Victoria][2]).

3. **Consider other VCE-approved law schools in Victoria** such as Deakin, La Trobe, RMIT or Victoria University if your predicted ATAR is lower or as a backup; they still lead to full accreditation for practice in Victoria ([lawadmissions.vic.gov.au][5], [vu.edu.au][16]).

4. **Check VTAC’s CourseSearch Prerequisite Explorer** to confirm exact prerequisites and required score thresholds for entry into 2026 / 2027 law intakes ([VTAC][18]).
