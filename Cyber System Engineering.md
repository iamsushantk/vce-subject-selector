Here‚Äôs a structured pathway within the **Australian Defence Force (ADF)** to pursue a career as a **Cyber Systems Engineer** (also known as **Electronics Engineer ‚Äì Cyber Systems** or **Cyber Warfare Officer**) ‚Äî from VCE through to joining and progression:

---

## üß≠ VCE (Year 11‚Äì12): Academic Foundation

* **Required:**

  * **English Units 3‚Äë4** (‚â•20)
  * **Mathematical Methods Units 3‚Äë4** (preferably Specialist if available)
* **Strongly recommended:**

  * **Physics Units 1‚Äë4** and/or **Systems Engineering Units 1‚Äë4** to earn selection rank advantages and prepare for technical challenges.

These subjects support entry into STEM degrees and strengthen your aptitude for engineering and cyber roles. ([GradConnection][1], [APS jobs (New build)][2])

---

## üéì University Degree: Engineering or Computing & Cyber Security

You‚Äôll need a qualifying STEM degree such as:

* **Bachelor of Engineering (Honours)**, specialising in electronics or cyber systems; or
* **Bachelor of Computing and Cyber Security** (offered by **UNSW Canberra at ADFA**).

These degree options enable entry into **Electronics Engineer ‚Äì Cyber Systems** or **Cyber Warfare Officer** roles.

**Entry routes:**

* **ADFA (Australian Defence Force Academy):** Combines military training with UNSW degree study; become an Officer Cadet while earning your degree. ([Wikipedia][3], [ADF Careers][4])
* **Defence University Sponsorship (DUS):** Sponsorship while studying a civilian degree, with guaranteed Officer entry after graduation. ([ADF Careers][5])

## üöÄ Recruited Role: Cyber Engineering in the ADF

### **Electronics Engineer ‚Äì Cyber Systems**

Offered via ADFA, Graduate or Undergraduate Officer Entry. You'll:

* Lead teams to maintain, protect, and deploy complex defence networks‚Äîincluding space and airborne systems. ([ADF Careers][6])
* Receive pay while you study; officer starting salary (\~\$111,000/year post-graduation). ([ADF Careers][6])

### **Cyber Warfare Officer** (RAAF)

* Focused on defending ADF cyberspace: leading technical experts, strategy, and operations. ([ADF Careers][7])
* Starting salary after training: around \$93,973 + superannuation. ([ADF Careers][7])

#### Which role fits your degree?

* Engineering degree ‚Üí **Electronics Engineer ‚Äì Cyber Systems**
* Cybersecurity/computing degree ‚Üí **Cyber Warfare Officer** is more aligned. ([ADF Careers][8], [Reddit][9])

## üßë‚Äçüéì While at University: Defence STEM Cadetship

The **STEM Cadetship Program** offers:

* Paid part‚Äëtime APS employment during your STEM degree. ([APS jobs (New build)][2])
* Reimbursement of compulsory university fees.
* Exposure to Defence projects in cyber security, system engineering, data science, electronic warfare, and more. ([APS jobs (New build)][2], [Defence][10])

Eligibility:

* Australian citizen, in STEM bachelor (with ‚â•12 months study left), finishing between 2026‚Äì2028. ([APS jobs (New build)][2])
