## âœ… Recommended VCE Plan for Aeronautical/Aerospace Engineering

- **Must**: English Unitsâ€¯3â€“4 (Yearâ€¯12)
- **Must**: Mathematics Unitsâ€¯3â€“4 â€“ ideally Mathematical Methods (and Specialist if available)
- **Recommended**: Physics and Systems Engineering Unitsâ€¯3â€“4
- **Extra**: Chemistry Unitsâ€¯3â€“4 for stronger scientific foundations and rank boosts
- **Optional**: IT-related VCE subjects (if available), for selection rank advantage

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

1. Make sure you choose **Mathematical Methods** in Yearâ€¯11 to continue into Yearâ€¯12 and aim for Specialist Maths if you're capable.
2. Add **Physics** and/or **Systems Engineering** in Yearâ€¯11 to prepare for Unitsâ€¯3â€“4.
3. Meet **VTAC CourseSearch prerequisites** by 2026/27â€”use the Prerequisite Explorer to confirm your eligibility based on planned subjects :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}
4. Aim for the required **ATAR**:
   - **~80â€“85** for RMIT or Monash entry paths
   - **Higher ATAR (midâ€‘90s)** if considering University of Melbourneâ€™s Master of Engineering route
5. Consider starting with **RMITâ€™s Advanced Diploma in Aeronautical Engineering** if you prefer a vocational start with guaranteed university entry and credit transfer.
