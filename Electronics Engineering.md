## ‚úÖ What to Do Next

1. Plan Year 11 & 12 subjects to include Methods (and Specialist if possible), Physics, and English.
2. Use **VTAC CourseSearch** and the Prerequisite Explorer to verify subject requirements for 2027 entry. ([Victoria Government][8], [vtac.edu.au][11])
3. If strong ATAR is anticipated, aim for RMIT or Swinburne. If your ATAR might be lower, Victoria University offers excellent access without minimum ATAR.
4. Consider the **Advanced Diploma route** at RMIT or other providers if a vocational start appeals‚Äîthis gives both industry skills and seamless progression to degree with credit.
5. Look for internship, project, and industry experience opportunities during the degree to strengthen employability in communications, embedded systems, and electronics.
